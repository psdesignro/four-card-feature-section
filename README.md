## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS


### What I learned

I've practiced a bit the CSS grid to get the desired layout, even if I started with Flexbox and some additional divs in HTML, I considered that nesting similar elements is not the best approach for a responsive layout.

Again I've used SASS just to practice it, as it could work with plain CSS also


### Continued development

I should practice more different ways to get a responsive design without media queries
